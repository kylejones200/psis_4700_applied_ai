# Week 3 — Applications Across Domains (STEW-style Lesson Plan)

- Audience: Adult undergraduates (hybrid/online)
- Duration: 3 hours contact + 1–2 hours prep

## Overview
Explore AI applications across sectors via short case studies. Evaluate feasibility, risks, and value. Prepare a brief domain analysis.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify common AI application patterns in multiple domains.
- Evaluate feasibility using value/cost/risk and data readiness.
- Draft a short case analysis using a provided template.

## Materials & Tools
- Slides: `slides_intro/week-03-applications.md`
- Case study template handout (problem, data, method, results, risks, next steps)
- Optional guest speaker (practitioner) or recorded talk

## Key Vocabulary
- ROI, feasibility, stakeholders, KPIs, build vs buy, integration, governance

## Prerequisites
- Weeks 1–2 core concepts; familiarity with metrics

## Schedule (3:00)
- 0:00–0:10 Recap & goals
- 0:10–0:35 Lightning mini-lecture: domain patterns and pitfalls
- 0:35–1:05 Case gallery: 3–4 short examples (health, finance, public)
- 1:05–1:15 Break
- 1:15–1:45 Guest/practitioner talk + Q&A (or recorded)
- 1:45–2:20 Group work: fill case template for chosen domain
- 2:20–2:45 Share-outs; peer feedback using rubric
- 2:45–2:55 Instructor synthesis; pointers to readings
- 2:55–3:00 Exit ticket

## Warm-Up (10 min)
- Prompt: “Name a task in your field that is repetitive, data-rich, and high-impact.”

## Core Activities
- Gallery of succinct case studies with benefits/risks callouts.
- Group template completion; instructor circulates and probes assumptions.
- Short share-outs with 1 slide per group and quick peer feedback.

## Differentiation
- Provide domain-specific exemplars for varied majors.
- Offer optional deeper dives for technical learners (integration diagrams).

## Assessment
- Formative: Exit ticket stating the top feasibility risk.
- Summative: 2–3 page domain proposal with KPIs and risk mitigation.

## Homework/Prep (60–90 min)
- Draft the domain proposal; read a curated success story in your domain.

## Instructor Notes
- Keep focus on feasibility and ethics; avoid tech rabbit holes.
- Timebox group work; use a visible timer.

## Accessibility & Inclusion
- Provide case texts as accessible docs; ensure contrast and font size.

## References
- Sector reports; curated case study library; organizational AI guidelines.
