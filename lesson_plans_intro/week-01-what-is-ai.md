# Week 1 — What Is AI? (STEW-style Lesson Plan)

- Audience: Adult undergraduates (hybrid/online)
- Duration: 3 hours contact + 1–2 hours prep/reflection

## Overview
Introduce AI history, core definitions, current capabilities/limits, and responsible use. Students experience simple demos and reflect on AI in their field.

## Learning Objectives
- Define AI, ML, and DL in plain language.
- Distinguish symbolic vs statistical vs generative approaches.
- Identify opportunities/risks of AI in students’ domains.
- Practice critical evaluation of AI demos.

## Materials & Tools
- Slides: `slides_intro/week-01-what-is-ai.md`
- Demo access: hosted chatbot and text-to-image tool
- Whiteboard/jamboard for brainstorming

## Key Vocabulary
- AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Prompt, Token, Embedding, Hallucination, Bias, Transparency

## Prerequisites
- Basic computer literacy; no coding required

## Schedule (3:00)
- 0:00–0:10 Welcome, course map, expectations
- 0:10–0:25 Definitions: AI vs ML vs DL; symbolic/statistical/generative
- 0:25–0:40 History and hype cycles; current capabilities/limits
- 0:40–1:00 Demo 1: Chatbot with citations (live)
- 1:00–1:10 Break
- 1:10–1:30 Demo 2: Text-to-image with safety filters
- 1:30–2:00 Guided Activity: AI in your field (think-pair-share)
- 2:00–2:30 Mini-debate: benefits vs risks in one use-case
- 2:30–2:55 Gallery share + instructor synthesis
- 2:55–3:00 Exit ticket

## Warm-Up (10 min)
- Prompt: “Name one AI system you used this week. What did it do well/poorly?”

## Core Activities
- Demo walkthroughs with instructor think-aloud on limits and safety.
- Think-Pair-Share: map 2 opportunities and 2 risks in students’ domains.
- Mini-debate: small groups build 2-slide argument for/against one use-case.

## Differentiation
- Provide non-technical and technical examples.
- Offer optional advanced reading for technical learners.

## Assessment
- Formative: Exit ticket with two prompts (value + risk in major).
- Summative (post-class): 1-page concept brief (use-case, benefit, risk).

## Homework/Prep (60–90 min)
- Read: beginner-friendly AI overview.
- Submit concept brief draft for feedback.

## Instructor Notes
- Emphasize limits and responsible use; set tone for adult, applied focus.
- Keep demos short; invite students to suggest prompts.

## Accessibility & Inclusion
- Ensure captions or transcripts for videos; high-contrast slides.

## References
- Course slides; curated primers on AI history and terminology.
