# Capstone: Applied AI App Project (8-Week Course)

## Goal
Each student designs, builds, and publishes a small AI-powered application that demonstrates practical use of an existing model. The app must run end-to-end, have visible input/output, and be posted publicly on GitHub.

## Timeline and Milestones
- Week 5 — Proposal (10%): One-page concept with problem, user, AI model/API, and tools (FastAPI/Streamlit/Flask or notebook).
- Week 6 — Prototype (15%): Connect to API/pretrained model; basic working demo.
- Week 7 — Build and Polish (25%): Finalize logic, UI/visualization; ensure local run or free hosting (GitHub Pages, Hugging Face Spaces, Render).
- Week 8 — Publish and Present (50%): Push code and docs to GitHub; live or recorded 5-minute demo.

## Repository Requirements
- app/ or notebooks/ with working code
- data/ with small sample dataset (if used)
- README.md (purpose, setup, model)
- ethics.md (bias, fairness, privacy)
- requirements.txt (dependencies)
- images/ (screenshots)
- LICENSE (optional)

## Allowed Tools
- Streamlit or FastAPI; OpenAI/Hugging Face/IBM watsonx APIs; Colab/Databricks; Matplotlib/Plotly.
- Students integrate/adapt rather than train from scratch.

## Evaluation Rubric (100 pts)
- Proposal: 10 — clarity and feasibility.
- Functionality: 40 — runs, correct IO, model/API integrated.
- Documentation: 20 — README, comments, screenshots.
- Ethics: 10 — bias/privacy awareness and safeguards.
- Presentation: 10 — clear demo.
- Code Quality: 10 — structure and GitHub hygiene.
