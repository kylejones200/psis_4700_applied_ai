## Module 1: Foundations of Applied AI

**Question:** What does AI produce from input?  
**Answer:** An output based on patterns in data

**Question:** What does a model learn from?  
**Answer:** Examples in training data

**Question:** What is the goal of applied AI?  
**Answer:** Useful results that support real work

**Answer:** No. It follows patterns

**Question:** Who remains responsible for outcomes?  
**Answer:** The human user

**Question:** What makes AI different from rules?  
**Answer:** AI learns behavior from data instead of fixed logic

**Question:** What does a prediction represent?  
**Answer:** The model's best guess based on past patterns

## Module 2: Data and Quality

**Question:** What does a feature represent?  
**Answer:** An attribute used to make a prediction

**Question:** What happens when data has bias?  
**Answer:** The system produces unfair results

**Question:** What does missing data create?  
**Answer:** Gaps that weaken results

**Question:** Why does class balance matter?  
**Answer:** The model needs enough examples for each class

**Question:** What does "data coverage" mean?  
**Answer:** Whether the dataset reflects the full problem space

**Question:** What causes drift?  
**Answer:** Reality changes while the model stays the same

**Question:** Why should data sources be documented?  
**Answer:** So results can be trusted and reviewed

## Module 3: AI for Productivity

**Question:** What improves output quality most?  
**Answer:** Clear prompts and structured refinement

**Question:** What does iteration mean in AI workflows?  
**Answer:** Repeated improvement of prompts and results

**Question:** Why should users review outputs?  
**Answer:** The model can produce incorrect answers

**Question:** What makes a prompt effective?  
**Answer:** A clear goal, structure, and constraints

**Question:** What is the role of context in a prompt?  
**Answer:** It helps the model understand what matters

**Question:** Why should users compare versions of outputs?  
**Answer:** To see which refinement steps improve results

**Question:** What does a workflow template encourage?  
**Answer:** Consistent and repeatable practice

## Module 4: Model Families

**Question:** Which model assigns a label?  
**Answer:** Classification

**Question:** Which model groups similar records?  
**Answer:** Clustering

**Question:** Which model handles ordered data?  
**Answer:** Sequence models

**Question:** Which model detects unusual patterns?  
**Answer:** Anomaly models

**Question:** Which model suggests items to users?  
**Answer:** Recommendation models

**Question:** Why must the model match the problem type?  
**Answer:** The wrong model produces weak results

**Question:** What makes time series data different?  
**Answer:** Order and time dependence affect meaning

## Module 5: Ethics and Responsible Use

**Question:** Why does accountability matter in AI?  
**Answer:** People remain responsible for outcomes

**Question:** What does transparency support?  
**Answer:** Understanding and trust

**Question:** What is a privacy risk?  
**Answer:** Exposure of sensitive personal information

**Question:** What happens when humans over-trust AI?  
**Answer:** Harm may occur from unchecked errors

**Question:** Why must stakeholders be identified?  
**Answer:** They may feel the impact of decisions

**Question:** What reduces ethical risk?  
**Answer:** Human review and clear safeguards

**Question:** What should teams do before deployment?  
**Answer:** Evaluate risk and mitigation plans

## Module 6: Generative AI

**Question:** What does a large language model predict?  
**Answer:** The next token in context

**Question:** Why can outputs sound correct but be wrong?  
**Answer:** The model does not reason about truth

**Question:** What improves generative results?  
**Answer:** Specific goals, structure, and examples

**Question:** What does prompt refinement change?  
**Answer:** Clarity, context, and constraints

**Question:** What is the role of examples in prompts?  
**Answer:** They guide style and structure

**Question:** Why should users critique outputs?  
**Answer:** To identify errors and improve quality

**Question:** What makes GenAI useful in practice?  
**Answer:** It produces drafts for human judgment
