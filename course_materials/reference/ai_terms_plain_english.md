# AI Terms in Plain English

## Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence means software that performs tasks that normally require human judgment. The system takes input, applies a model, and produces an output such as text, a decision, or a prediction.

## Model
A model is a set of mathematical rules that connect inputs to outputs. The model follows patterns it learned from data and uses those patterns to answer new questions.

## Training Data
Training data is the set of examples the model studies before it produces results. Strong training data leads to better outputs. Weak training data leads to weak outputs.

## Machine Learning
Machine learning is a way to build models that learn patterns from data instead of using fixed rules written by a programmer.

## Prediction
A prediction is the model's best guess about a future value or an unknown value. The guess comes from patterns in past data.

## Classification
Classification means assigning a label to something. The model decides which category a case belongs to based on past examples.

## Clustering
Clustering means grouping similar things together. The model finds patterns that show which cases belong near each other.

## Bias
Bias means results that unfairly favor one group over another. Bias often comes from biased data or poor design choices.

## Hallucination
Hallucination means the model produces an answer that sounds correct but is not true. The model fills gaps instead of saying it does not know.

## Large Language Model
A large language model is a type of AI system that predicts the next word or token in a sequence based on patterns in text. The model does not understand meaning. It works through probability.

## Generative AI
Generative AI produces new text, images, audio, or code. The output looks original, but the model creates it from patterns in the data it studied.

## Prompt
A prompt is the instruction you give to the model. A clear prompt produces clearer results.

## Prompt Refinement
Prompt refinement means adjusting a prompt to improve the output. You change wording, add context, or set constraints to guide the model.

## Evaluation
Evaluation means checking whether the model produced a useful and correct result. People review outputs to confirm quality.

## Human in the Loop
Human in the loop means a person stays involved. The person sets the goal, checks the results, and decides what to accept or change.

## Privacy
Privacy means protecting personal or sensitive information. Good practice avoids exposing private data to AI systems.

## Drift
Drift means the world changes over time while the model stays the same. The model becomes less accurate because reality moved away from its training data.

## Transparency
Transparency means explaining how an AI system works at a level people can understand. The system should not feel like a hidden black box.

## Accountability
Accountability means people remain responsible for outcomes produced with AI. A tool does not replace human responsibility.
