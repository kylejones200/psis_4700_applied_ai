## The Core Idea

Data sovereignty means data follows the laws of the country it resides in.  
Localization means storing and processing data in specific regions

## Why It Matters

AI models often process personal or regulated information.  
Where and how that data moves defines legal exposure

> Understanding motivation helps you apply concepts appropriately rather than blindly following patterns. Context for why things matter prevents cargo-cult adoption of practices that don't fit your needs.

## Global Context

GDPR (EU): user consent and erasure rights.  
CCPA (US): transparency and opt-out.  
China, India, UAE: strict data residency laws

## Example

A healthcare AI in France must ensure patient data never leaves the EU.  
Model inference occurs in-region under local compliance

> Concrete examples illustrate how abstract concepts work in practice. Pay attention to context - what made this particular case succeed or fail may not transfer directly to your situation.

## Summary

Sovereignty defines trust.  
Localization turns compliance into architecture
