## The Core Idea

An agent is an AI system that performs tasks on behalf of a user  
Multi-agent systems combine several specialized agents that cooperate or compete

## Why It Matters

Single models respond  
Agents decide, act, and coordinate  
This shifts AI from conversation to execution

> Understanding motivation helps you apply concepts appropriately rather than blindly following patterns. Context for why things matter prevents cargo-cult adoption of practices that don't fit your needs.

## Anatomy of an Agent

Goal: what to achieve  
Memory: what has been done  
Tools: what it can use  
Planner: how to reach the goal

## Multi-Agent Example

Research Agent → summarizes sources  
Analysis Agent → compares evidence  
Report Agent → writes draft  
Supervisor → checks quality

> Multi-agent systems coordinate multiple AI agents with different roles, tools, and knowledge. This architecture enables more complex workflows than single agents can handle, with specialization and collaboration between agents.

## Benefits

Modular design  
Parallel execution  
Error isolation

> Benefits must be weighed against costs, risks, and alternatives. Consider whether value accrues equitably to all stakeholders or concentrates narrowly.
---

## Risks

Coordination failures  
Runaway loops  
Accountability issues

## Applications

Supply chain coordination  
Automated report writing  
Simulated environments
