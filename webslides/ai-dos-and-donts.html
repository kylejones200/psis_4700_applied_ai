        <h2>AI Dos and Don'ts</h2>
        <p>You use AI with intention. You think before you accept answers.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Treat AI as a Collaborator</h2>
        <p>You ask a question. AI gives an answer. You study the answer.</p>
        <p>You do not accept the first reply as final. You ask follow-up questions.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Engage in Dialogue</h2>
        <p>You refine the prompt. You adjust scope. You compare alternatives.</p>
        <p>You shape the output. You stay in control of the process.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Maintain Skepticism</h2>
        <p>You read with care. You verify facts. You check numbers.</p>
        <p>You review logic. You look for bias. You take responsibility.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Use Iteration as a Method</h2>
        <p>You begin with a draft. You improve the draft step by step.</p>
        <p>You request clarity. You request depth when needed.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Frame Clear Questions</h2>
        <p>You state the goal. You define constraints. You provide context.</p>
        <p>You avoid vague prompts. You write with precision.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Evaluate Quality with Purpose</h2>
        <p>You ask whether the answer fits the task. You test reasoning.</p>
        <p>You judge correctness. You judge usefulness. You judge truth.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Do Not Dismiss After One Bad Answer</h2>
        <p>You receive a weak response. You do not give up.</p>
        <p>You refine the prompt. You guide the model toward better work.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Protect Integrity</h2>
        <p>You add your insight. You explain choices in your voice.</p>
        <p>You cite when needed. You keep accountability.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Match Tool to Task</h2>
        <p>You use AI where it fits. You keep judgment with people.</p>
        <p>You respect limits. You apply AI where it adds value.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Think Before Automation</h2>
        <p>You define success. You confirm the objective.</p>
        <p>You let AI help with execution. You own direction.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Learn Through Reflection</h2>
        <p>You review the session. You note what worked. You note what failed.</p>
        <p>You improve practice over time.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>End</h2>
        <p>You treat AI use as a disciplined craft.</p>
