# AI Dos and Don'ts
>You explain that AI helps when people use it with intention. You say that students should think before they accept answers.

Example. You ask AI to define a concept. You receive a reply. You ask a second question to clarify meaning. You compare both answers.

Exercise. You ask AI a question from your field. You request a second version. You explain which version works better and why.

## Treat AI as a Collaborator
>You explain that AI works best as a partner, not as an answer machine.

You ask a question. AI gives an answer. You study the answer.
You do not accept the first reply as final. You ask follow-up questions.

Example. You ask AI to draft an email. You review tone. You request a more formal style. You approve the revision.

Exercise. You write a short prompt. You request two rounds of refinement. You explain how each round improves the result.

## Engage in Dialogue
>You explain that conversation shapes quality. You show how refinement improves results.

You refine the prompt. You adjust scope. You compare alternatives.
You shape the output. You stay in control of the process.

Example. You ask for a summary. You request more detail on one section. You request less detail on another section.

Exercise. You start with a vague prompt. You improve the prompt through three revisions. You describe the improvement.

## Maintain Skepticism
>You explain that students must verify information and think critically.

You read with care. You verify facts. You check numbers.
You review logic. You look for bias. You take responsibility.

Example. AI cites a statistic. You check the source. You confirm accuracy before you use it.

Exercise. You ask AI a factual question. You verify two statements in the reply with an outside source.

## Use Iteration as a Method
>You explain that improvement happens step by step through revision.

You begin with a draft. You improve the draft step by step.
You request clarity. You request depth when needed.

Example. AI writes a paragraph. You request clearer language. You request stronger verbs. You approve the revision.

Exercise. You ask AI for a first draft of a short explanation. You request two improvements. You evaluate the final draft.

## Frame Clear Questions
>You explain that clear prompts produce stronger outcomes.

You state the goal. You define constraints. You provide context.
You avoid vague prompts. You write with precision.

Example. You ask for a lesson plan. You specify level, length, and topic. You receive a better result than before.

Exercise. You rewrite a vague prompt into a precise prompt. You compare both responses.

## Evaluate Quality with Purpose
>You explain that students should judge results based on truth and usefulness.

You ask whether the answer fits the task. You test reasoning.
You judge correctness. You judge usefulness. You judge truth.

Example. AI gives a fluent answer. The logic fails. You reject the answer and request a correction.

Exercise. You rate an AI response on accuracy, clarity, and relevance. You explain your rating in one paragraph.

## Do Not Dismiss After One Bad Answer
>You explain that a weak response signals the need for better guidance.

You receive a weak response. You do not give up.
You refine the prompt. You guide the model toward better work.

Example. AI misunderstands the task. You restate the goal. The second answer succeeds.

Exercise. You take a weak reply. You rewrite the prompt. You produce a stronger reply.

## Protect Integrity
>You explain that students must keep their own voice and add their own insight.

You add your insight. You explain choices in your voice.
You cite when needed. You keep accountability.

Example. AI drafts a paragraph. You add examples from your experience. You credit sources where required.

Exercise. You take an AI draft. You insert your perspective. You explain the difference between your words and AI text.

## Match Tool to Task
>You explain that AI fits some work and not other work. You emphasize judgment.

You use AI where it fits. You keep judgment with people.
You respect limits. You apply AI where it adds value.

Example. You use AI to brainstorm ideas. You do not use AI to make ethical decisions.

Exercise. You list one task where AI helps. You list one task where a human must decide.

## Think Before Automation
>You explain that students should define success before they automate work.

You define success. You confirm the objective.
You let AI help with execution. You own direction.

Example. You plan the structure of a report. You ask AI to draft sections after the plan is clear.

Exercise. You write the goal of a task in one sentence. You explain how AI will assist, not direct.

## Learn Through Reflection
>You explain that disciplined practice strengthens skill over time.

You review the session. You note what worked. You note what failed.
You improve practice over time.

Example. You finish a session. You identify one prompt that worked and one prompt that failed.

Exercise. You write a short reflection after an AI session. You state one lesson you will apply next time.

## End
>You close by repeating that AI use functions as a disciplined craft.

You treat AI use as a disciplined craft.

Example. You remind students that skill grows through practice and intention.

Exercise. You write one personal rule for your own AI use.
