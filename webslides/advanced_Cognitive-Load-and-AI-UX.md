## The Core Idea

Good AI design reduces mental effort.  
The interface must explain, not overwhelm

## Why It Matters

Users need confidence in AI outputs.  
Transparency creates adoption

> Understanding motivation helps you apply concepts appropriately rather than blindly following patterns. Context for why things matter prevents cargo-cult adoption of practices that don't fit your needs.

## Good AI UX Principles

Show reasoning or evidence.  
Indicate uncertainty.  
Allow corrections.  
Keep context visible

> AI UX design balances powerful capabilities against cognitive load - the mental effort users must expend. Good design makes AI features discoverable and useful without overwhelming users with complexity.

## Example

A dashboard that shows confidence bars beside predictions helps users calibrate trust

> Concrete examples illustrate how abstract concepts work in practice. Pay attention to context - what made this particular case succeed or fail may not transfer directly to your situation.

## Bad UX Example

Black-box output with no explanation or control leads to rejection
