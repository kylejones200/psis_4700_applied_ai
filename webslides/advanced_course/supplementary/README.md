## Usage Suggestions

**As Weekly Supplements:**
- Assign as pre-reading before relevant weeks
- Use as basis for in-class discussions
- Provide as optional deep-dive materials

**As Standalone Workshops:**
- 1-2 hour focused sessions on specific topics
- Guest speaker presentations
- Student-led study groups

**For Custom Learning Paths:**
- Combine multiple topics for specialized tracks
- Create role-based curricula (e.g., AI Safety track, Enterprise AI track)
- Support capstone project directions

## File Naming Convention

All supplementary files follow the pattern: `advanced_[Topic-Name].md`

This distinguishes them from weekly lesson files and makes their purpose clear.
