## How to shape what models say — and how they think

> Implementation details often determine success or failure more than algorithmic choices. Practical considerations like error handling, monitoring, and operations matter as much as core functionality.

## The Core Idea

Prompt engineering guides models through structure  
Alignment ensures model values match human goals

## Prompt Techniques

Clear instruction ("Summarize this email")  
Role prompting ("You are a policy analyst")  
Chain-of-thought prompting ("Let's reason step by step")

## Why Alignment Matters

Models mimic patterns  
Without alignment, they can produce biased, unsafe, or nonsensical results

> Understanding motivation helps you apply concepts appropriately rather than blindly following patterns. Context for why things matter prevents cargo-cult adoption of practices that don't fit your needs.

## RLHF

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback trains models to prefer good behavior  
Humans grade responses  
Models learn from rewards

## Example

Prompt: "Write a hiring ad."  
Unaligned model: biased language  
Aligned model: inclusive tone and compliance

> Concrete examples illustrate how abstract concepts work in practice. Pay attention to context - what made this particular case succeed or fail may not transfer directly to your situation.

## Summary

Prompts steer behavior  
Alignment keeps it ethical  
Together they define voice and intent
