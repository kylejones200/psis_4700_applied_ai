## Usage

Each weekly folder contains the main lesson presentation. Supplementary topics can be:
- Integrated into weekly lessons as deep-dive segments
- Used as homework/reading assignments
- Presented as standalone workshops
- Combined for custom learning paths

## Relation to Intro Course

This advanced course assumes completion of the 8-week Introduction to Applied AI course:
- Week 1-2 (Intro): What is AI, Data & Learning
- Week 3-4 (Intro): Applications, Ethics & Policy
- Week 5-6 (Intro): Generative/Conversational AI, Deployment
- Week 7-8 (Intro): Project Workshop, Capstone

The advanced course goes deeper into technical implementation, architecture, and advanced techniques.
