## Why We're Here

AI is everywhere, but most people don't know how to use it meaningfully.  
You don't need to be a data scientist.  
You need to understand where AI fits — and where it doesn't

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.

## The Core Question

Not "What can AI do?"  
But "Where does AI create measurable value for my team or company?"

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.

## What AI Actually Does

AI does three things well:  
Finds patterns in data.  
Automates repetitive reasoning.  
Generates content from examples.  
Everything else builds on those

## The Business Lens

AI adds value when it does at least one of these:  
Saves time  
Improves decisions  
Increases accuracy  
Enhances customer experience  
Enables new products or services

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.

## Value ≠ Novelty

AI value comes from impact, not innovation theater.  
If no one saves time, makes better choices, or earns more revenue, the project fails

## The Three Value Zones

| Zone | Description | Example |  
|------|-------------|---------|  
| Efficiency | Doing the same work faster | Automate report writing |  
| Effectiveness | Doing better work | Forecast demand more accurately |  
| Expansion | Doing new work | Launch an AI-powered product |

## Efficiency: Automate and Accelerate

Look for repetitive tasks with clear inputs and outputs.  
Examples: document summarization, email triage, meeting notes, scheduling.  
AI reduces friction and frees people for higher-value work

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.
---

## Effectiveness: Improve Decisions

AI helps people reason across data they can't process manually.  
Examples: risk scoring, forecasting, trend detection.  
The goal is not to replace judgment, but to enhance it

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.
---

## Expansion: Create New Offerings

Once internal operations run smoothly, use AI to build new services.  
Examples: personalized learning, predictive maintenance, smart recommendations.  
AI becomes a growth engine, not just a cost saver

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.

## The "Should We Use AI?" Test

Ask:  
Is there data to learn from?  
Is the outcome repetitive or predictable?  
Would faster or better answers make money or save money?  
If yes, explore AI. If no, keep it manual

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.

## The AI Value Chain

Data — the raw material.  
Models — the reasoning engine.  
Applications — the delivery mechanism.  
Adoption — the human factor that determines success

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.

## Where Projects Fail

Poor data quality.  
No clear business metric.  
Shiny tool syndrome.  
No plan for user adoption.  
Technology rarely fails. Execution does

## The Role of People

AI augments human work.  
It thrives where people and machines complement each other.  
The most successful organizations train people to use AI, not fear it

## Framing the Conversation at Work

When introducing AI:  
Speak in outcomes, not algorithms.  
Tie use cases to pain points.  
Quantify benefits (time, dollars, risk reduction).  
Start small and measurable

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.

## Example: HR Department

Problem: Too much time screening résumés.  
AI Value: Automate first-pass filtering while keeping human review.  
Outcome: Faster hiring cycle, consistent evaluation

> Concrete examples illustrate abstract concepts and show how ideas apply in practice. Pay attention to what made these particular cases succeed or fail.

## Example: Customer Service

Problem: Long wait times and repetitive questions.  
AI Value: Deploy a chatbot for common issues  
Escalate complex ones
Outcome: Lower cost per ticket, higher satisfaction

## The Change Journey

Awareness — teach teams what AI is.  
Exploration — test ideas safely.  
Integration — embed AI in workflows.  
Scaling — align AI with business goals.  
Each step requires leadership and trust
