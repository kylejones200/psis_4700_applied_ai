## Two ways to make models smarter — one adds data, the other changes memory

## The Core Idea

You can customize a model in two main ways:  
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Keep the model fixed, feed it extra context.  
Fine-Tuning: Retrain the model with new examples to change its behavior

## What RAG Does

RAG retrieves documents at query time.  
It adds external knowledge on demand.  
The model doesn't learn permanently — it reads and reasons from current data

## What Fine-Tuning Does

Fine-tuning changes the model itself.  
It teaches new vocabulary, formats, or reasoning styles.  
The knowledge becomes "baked in."

## When to Use RAG

You have changing data.  
You want transparency and traceability.  
You can't modify the base model.  
Examples:  
Company policy Q&A.  
Product support bots

## When to Use Fine-Tuning

You have stable, structured examples.  
You need specialized tone or behavior.  
Examples:  
Legal or medical summarization style.  
Customer-service tone training

## Cost and Maintenance

RAG is cheaper to update — just refresh documents.  
Fine-tuning is costlier but more cohesive.  
Most production systems combine both

## Security and Control

RAG can filter sensitive data before retrieval.  
Fine-tuning must ensure no confidential data enters training

## Combined Approach

Many enterprises use:  
Fine-tuning for structure and tone.  
RAG for knowledge and freshness.  
It's not "either/or" — it's layered design

## Summary

RAG = flexible, dynamic context.  
Fine-tuning = deep, lasting knowledge.  
Together they make AI practical and adaptive
