# Week 7
# Applied AI Systems

---

## From Prototype to Production

Models must integrate with data pipelines and applications

---

## APIs and Microservices

Expose models as endpoints  
Version and log each call

---

## Databricks and Lakehouse

Unified platform for storage, training, and governance

---

## Vector Databases

Use Pinecone or Chroma for semantic retrieval  
Connect embeddings to applications

---

## Edge and IoT

Compress models for sensors and gateways  
MQTT and OPC-UA stream data to the cloud

---

## MLOps and Monitoring

Track metrics, drift, and re-training schedules  
Tools: MLflow, Airflow, and Weights & Biases

---

## Case Example

Predictive maintenance in manufacturing using sensor streams

---

## Summary

Applied AI means operational AI  
Success depends on data quality and feedback loops
