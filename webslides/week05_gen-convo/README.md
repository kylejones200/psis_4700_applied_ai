# Week 5: Generative and Conversational Models

## Overview
Introduce large language models (LLMs) and image generation at a conceptual level. Build a small chatbot or prompt pipeline with basic safety guardrails.

## Learning Objectives
- Explain prompting, context windows, and the idea of grounding
- Design a simple prompt template and basic evaluation checks
- Build a tiny chatbot/prompt pipeline and add 3-5 safety checks
