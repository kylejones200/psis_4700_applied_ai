## The Core Idea

AI grows along a curve:  
Productivity — do the same work faster.  
Intelligence — make better decisions.  
Creativity — create new value entirely

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.

## Level 1: Productivity

AI as automation.  
Goal: speed and consistency.  
You replace manual effort with AI assistance

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.
---

## What Productivity AI Looks Like

Summarizing meetings or documents.  
Drafting emails and reports.  
Automating data entry or cleanup.  
Generating first drafts of presentations.  
These tasks save time but don't change the work itself

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.

## Why Productivity Matters

It frees time for higher-value work.  
It standardizes quality.  
It builds comfort with AI use.  
It is the foundation for later stages

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.
---

## The Limitation

Productivity gains plateau.  
You eventually automate all simple tasks.  
Next comes using AI to think, not type

> Understanding challenges and limitations is as important as knowing capabilities. Realistic assessment of obstacles helps you plan appropriately and avoid nasty surprises.
---

## Level 2: Intelligence

AI as an analytical partner.  
Goal: insight and precision.  
You use AI to detect patterns and support decisions

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.
---

## What Intelligent AI Looks Like

Forecasting demand or prices.  
Identifying risks in contracts.  
Recommending next actions for customers.  
Synthesizing research findings.  
AI now reasons across data, not just formats it

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.

## How It Adds Value

It improves accuracy and foresight.  
It helps people make better calls faster.  
It converts information into advantage

> AI adds value through automation, augmentation, insights, and personalization. Understanding these value categories helps identify where AI might actually help versus where it's just technical novelty.
---

## The Transition

Moving from Level 1 to Level 2 requires:  
Clean, accessible data.  
Defined metrics for decision quality.  
Staff who trust the outputs.  
Technology alone is not enough  
Mindset must evolve

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.
---

## The Limitation

Analytical AI still operates inside known rules.  
It optimizes the current system.  
It doesn't imagine new ones

> Understanding challenges and limitations is as important as knowing capabilities. Realistic assessment of obstacles helps you plan appropriately and avoid nasty surprises.
---

## Level 3: Creativity

AI as collaborator and innovator.  
Goal: novel solutions.  
You use AI to design, invent, and explore new possibilities

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.
---

## What Creative AI Looks Like

Generating new product ideas or service models.  
Designing marketing campaigns from trends.  
Writing original learning materials.  
Simulating policy options or future scenarios.  
The work itself becomes new

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.
---

## How It Adds Value

Creative AI expands the frontier.  
It uncovers patterns people can't see.  
It creates intellectual property, not just output.  
It makes innovation scalable

> AI adds value through automation, augmentation, insights, and personalization. Understanding these value categories helps identify where AI might actually help versus where it's just technical novelty.

## Example Progression

| Level | Focus | Example | Outcome |  
|-------|-------|---------|---------|  
| 1 — Productivity | Automate tasks | Draft meeting summaries | Save time |  
| 2 — Intelligence | Support decisions | Predict customer churn | Improve accuracy |  
| 3 — Creativity | Generate novelty | Design a new service model | Create value |

> Concrete examples illustrate abstract concepts and show how ideas apply in practice. Pay attention to what made these particular cases succeed or fail.

## Organizational Readiness

Level 1 needs tools and workflows.  
Level 2 needs data and trust.  
Level 3 needs vision and experimentation.  
Each step builds on the last

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.
---

## The Common Mistake

Trying to jump to "creative AI" before mastering the basics.  
Without productivity and intelligence foundations, creative AI fails to scale

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.
---

## Thinking Framework

Ask three questions:  
What type of value am I creating — time saved, quality improved, or new growth?  
What data or knowledge does AI need to deliver it?  
How will I measure success?  
These define your level and guide your design

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.
