## The Core Idea

AI is no longer about algorithms.  
It's about how people, systems, and ideas connect.  
You've learned not only what AI does — but how to think with it

## What We Started With

We began with foundations:  
Tokens, embeddings, and context.  
How computers "see" and "read."  
What makes data AI-ready.  
That built your mental model of how intelligence is represented

## Building from the Core

Then we looked at frameworks and techniques:  
Fine-tuning and retrieval.  
Ethics, bias, and governance.  
The lifecycle of AI projects.  
You saw that success is a process, not an event

## Expanding the View

We explored the systems that make AI work:  
Multi-modal understanding.  
Edge and private models.  
Agents and orchestration.  
You saw how intelligence can be distributed, yet connected

## Organizational Maturity

You learned how organizations scale AI responsibly:  
ROI and cost models.  
Change management.  
Maturity roadmaps and operating models.  
AI becomes a capability — not a tool

## The Human Thread

Every system needs people at its center.  
You saw how collaboration, alignment, and design create trust.  
AI amplifies judgment — it doesn't replace it

## The New Workflow

Now, workflows are composable.  
Context is shared across systems.  
Models talk to each other.  
Protocols replace toolchains.  
AI becomes an environment, not an add-on

## What Literacy Means Now

AI literacy means knowing what to ask, what to trust, and how to act.  
It's the ability to:  
Frame a problem clearly.  
Choose the right model.  
Interpret the output responsibly.  
Integrate AI into daily work

## The Capstone Challenge

Design a use case that connects:  
A real business or social problem.  
A clear workflow or data source.  
A defined model interaction (e.g., retrieval, vision, or multimodal).  
A plan for value and governance.  
You're not proving what AI can do — you're proving how it fits

## The Mindset to Keep

AI changes fast.  
Your literacy lets you stay steady.  
When tools evolve, your reasoning remains

## Final Thought

The goal of this course was not to make you a coder.  
It was to make you fluent.  
Fluent in the language of models, data, and meaning.  
That's the new literacy of work
