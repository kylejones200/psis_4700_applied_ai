# Flash Boys: Speed, Algorithms, and the 2010 Flash Crash

## Flash Boys: Speed Becomes a Weapon

- By 2009, Wall Street competes on speed, not only insight
- A firm called Spread Networks builds an 827-mile fiber line from Chicago to New Jersey
- The line cuts data travel from about 17 ms to about 13 ms at a cost near $300 million
- Each millisecond becomes a trading edge worth millions

> Open with the image of a $300 million cable for four milliseconds. Stress how absurd that sounds to normal people. Make the point that speed itself becomes the product.

## How Algorithms See the Market

- Orders hit one exchange a few microseconds before others
- High-frequency traders watch that first hint of demand
- Their algorithms rush to other exchanges and buy the same stock first
- They then sell back to the original buyer at a slightly higher price
- The profit per share is tiny, but billions of shares make it huge

> Describe this as a "race you never see." Explain that no law needs to break here. The code exploits the structure and the speed gap.

## May 6, 2010: The Flash Crash

- **Date:** May 6, 2010
- **Time window:** about 2:32 p.m. to 3:08 p.m. New York time
- The Dow Jones plunges almost 1,000 points in minutes, about 9 percent intraday
- Roughly $1 trillion in market value vanishes and then mostly reappears
- Accenture prints trades at one cent a share for a moment

> Let this sound chaotic and fast. Use one or two concrete names. "Accenture at one cent" makes the story feel real and wrong.

## What Triggered the Meltdown

- A large mutual fund sells a huge block of E-Mini S&P 500 futures
- Its algorithm keeps selling as long as the market has "volume"
- High-frequency traders first buy those contracts, then dump them back into the market
- This hot-potato effect pushes prices down faster and faster
- Liquidity vanishes, spreads explode, and many bids pull away

> Explain that nothing "broke" in the code from a technical view. The design of the strategy plus the design of the market create a feedback loop. Emphasize that the speed and automation amplify a normal large trade.

## When Algorithms Meet Fragile Markets

- Markets now route orders across many exchanges under Regulation NMS
- High-frequency traders game tiny price gaps across venues
- During stress, those same strategies pull out and leave a vacuum
- The result is a cliff: prices fall with almost no buyers in sight
- Human traders cannot react in milliseconds, so the machines dominate the move

> Draw a contrast between human time and machine time. Say "by the time a person sees the drop, the damage has already happened." This sets up your broader point about AI and systemic risk.

## Brad Katsuyama's "This Market Is Rigged" Moment

- Brad Katsuyama trades U.S. stocks for RBC in New York
- He clicks "buy" and watches prices jump away before his orders fill
- His team tests and proves that fast traders see his orders first and race ahead
- He concludes that the market structure lets insiders skim regular investors

> Tell this like a detective story. He notices a small glitch. He pulls the thread and finds a whole hidden system based on speed.

## IEX and the 350-Microsecond Roadblock

- Katsuyama and his team found a new stock exchange called IEX
- **Core idea:** add a 350 microsecond "speed bump" to every order
- That delay cancels the advantage of ultra-fast traders
- Orders cannot win only because they sit closer to the data center
- IEX sells itself as a "fair" market for long-term investors

> Explain how tiny 350 microseconds sound. Then say that in this world 350 microseconds is huge. This shows how fine the margins are and how precise the engineering is.

## What This Story Says About Algorithms

- The code follows incentives: speed, volume, and profit per microsecond
- The market rules and structure shape what the algorithms do
- During stress, those algorithms can drain liquidity and magnify panic
- Flash Boys shows how design, not intent, can create a rigged feeling system

> Tie this back to AI. Say that algorithms will chase whatever you reward. If you reward speed without regard for stability, you get fragility at machine speed. End with a question: "What incentives will we build into the next wave of AI systems?"
