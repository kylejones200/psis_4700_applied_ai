## How reusable components combine to build smarter, scalable solutions

## Why This Matters

AI solutions used to be built from scratch  
Now, we assemble them from ready-made parts  
Understanding these parts helps you design faster and think more strategically

## The Core Idea

Modern AI is modular  
You don't build everything — you compose  
Each component handles one clear job  
Together, they form an intelligent system

> This slide explores an important aspect of working with AI systems. Understanding this concept will help you make better decisions when evaluating and deploying AI in your work.

## Analogy

Think of AI like LEGO  
Each brick does something specific  
You can build a small toy or a whole city — same bricks, different arrangement

## Why Modularity Matters

Reuse reduces time and cost  
Proven components lower risk  
You can upgrade parts without rebuilding the system  
Teams can innovate faster and focus on value

## The Building Blocks of AI Systems

Model — the reasoning engine (LLM or classifier)  
Data — context, embeddings, documents  
Interface — how users interact (chat, API, app)  
Retrieval — how information is fetched (RAG, search)  
Memory — how the system keeps state or history  
Orchestration — how all pieces talk to each other (protocols, APIs)

> Thinking of AI as composable building blocks rather than monolithic systems enables faster iteration and clearer thinking. Modern AI applications assemble pre-built components rather than training everything from scratch.

## Example: Chatbot as a Building Block

A chatbot is not a full product — it's a user interface  
It can answer questions, route tasks, or collect input  
When combined with retrieval or workflow automation, it becomes a business tool

> Concrete examples illustrate abstract concepts and show how ideas apply in practice. Pay attention to what made these particular cases succeed or fail.
---

## Example: RAG as a Building Block

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) connects a model to external knowledge  
The model generates text, but RAG ensures accuracy by grounding answers in real data  
RAG is a "memory brick" — reusable in any domain

> Retrieval-Augmented Generation grounds language models in real documents by retrieving relevant information before generating responses. This architecture has become standard for building reliable knowledge systems.
---

## How RAG Works Conceptually

A user asks a question  
The system retrieves relevant documents  
The model reads them  
The model produces an informed answer  
That same pipeline can support search, reports, or assistants

> Retrieval-Augmented Generation grounds language models in real documents by retrieving relevant information before generating responses. This architecture has become standard for building reliable knowledge systems.

## Example: Embedding Layer

Embeddings convert text into numbers  
They power similarity search, recommendations, and knowledge matching  
Once created, they can be reused across products

> Embeddings are mathematical representations of meaning that enable semantic search and similarity comparison. They've become foundational to modern AI systems, powering everything from search to recommendations.
---

## Example: Context Protocols

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) lets systems share data safely  
It defines how the model retrieves just what it needs — no scraping or manual connection  
It is the "plumbing" layer for modular AI

> Concrete examples illustrate abstract concepts and show how ideas apply in practice. Pay attention to what made these particular cases succeed or fail.

## How Building Blocks Connect

| Component | Function | Example |  
|-----------|----------|---------|  
| Model | Reasoning | GPT, Claude, Gemini |  
| Retrieval | Context | RAG pipeline |  
| Interface | Interaction | Chatbot UI |  
| Memory | Continuity | Conversation history |  
| Governance | Safety | Permissions, audits |

## Real Example: AI Customer Service Platform

Chatbot handles questions  
RAG retrieves product documents  
Summarizer condenses logs  
Sentiment analyzer detects tone  
Dashboard displays analytics  
Each piece can evolve separately

> Concrete examples illustrate abstract concepts and show how ideas apply in practice. Pay attention to what made these particular cases succeed or fail.

## Why Businesses Use This Approach

Easier to maintain  
Easier to audit and improve  
Fits within existing architecture  
Supports faster experimentation and scaling

## The Shift in Thinking

Old way: one big model that does everything  
New way: small, specialized models that collaborate  
Composition outperforms complexity

## The AI Stack Today

Foundation Model — reasoning engine  
Adaptation Layer — fine-tuning, prompts, adapters  
Retrieval Layer — context via embeddings or RAG  
Application Layer — chat, dashboard, workflow  
Each layer can change without breaking the rest

## Example: Energy Analytics Assistant

Uses a chatbot to answer operator questions  
RAG retrieves compliance and maintenance records  
Summarizer condenses inspection reports  
Visualizer plots equipment trends  
All blocks reusable across plants

## Common Building Blocks in the Enterprise

| Function | Typical Component | Example Use |  
|----------|-------------------|-------------|  
| Interaction | Chatbot | Employee helpdesk |  
| Retrieval | RAG | Policy lookup |  
| Classification | Sentiment / topic model | Customer feedback |  
| Generation | LLM | Report drafting |  
| Orchestration | MCP or API | Connect data sources |

## Discussion Prompt

What reusable AI blocks already exist in your workplace?  
How could combining them unlock a new workflow or product?  
Sketch one idea — no code, just components

## Summary

AI solutions are built, not born  
Chatbots, RAG, embeddings, and context protocols are modules you can assemble  
Understanding them turns you from consumer to designer

## Key Takeaway

Stop asking "What model should I use?"  
Start asking "What blocks do I already have, and how can I connect them?"  
That mindset is the foundation of scalable AI design
