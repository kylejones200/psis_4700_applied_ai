## The Core Idea

No single model does everything well.  
Multi-model systems layer strengths: one detects, one summarizes, another predicts

## Why It Matters

Reduces single-point failure.  
Handles varied data — text, images, and numbers.  
Enables specialization while staying general enough to scale

> Understanding why concepts matter helps you apply them appropriately. This context prevents cargo-cult adoption of practices that don't fit your situation.

## Common Architectures

Ensemble: several models vote on an answer.  
Chained: one model's output feeds another's input.  
Hybrid: mixes classical ML and LLM components

## Example

Energy-trading system:  
Time-series model forecasts prices.  
LLM summarizes market news.  
Optimization model recommends trades.  
Each model focuses on what it does best

> Concrete examples illustrate how abstract concepts apply in practice. Studying both successes and failures reveals patterns worth emulating or avoiding.

## Coordination and Latency

Multi-model designs need orchestration.  
Use caching, batching, and asynchronous calls to keep performance high

---

## Governance and Testing

Track which model made each decision.  
Evaluate both individual and combined performance

> AI governance establishes policies, processes, oversight mechanisms, and accountability for responsible deployment. This includes defining acceptable use, review procedures, incident response, and continuous monitoring.

## Summary

Multi-model AI is collaboration among models.  
Diversity produces resilience.  
Integration delivers strength
