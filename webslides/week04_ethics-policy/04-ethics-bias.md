## The Core Idea

AI reflects the data it learns from  
If that data carries bias, the model repeats it — faster and at scale  
Ethics is about detecting, reducing, and explaining that bias

## What Bias Looks Like

Bias isn't just social. It can be:  
Sampling bias: the data excludes key groups  
Label bias: human labels reflect assumptions  
Algorithmic bias: model design favors certain outcomes

> AI ethics addresses fairness, accountability, transparency, privacy, and societal impact. Bias can enter at every stage from data collection through deployment, requiring active mitigation throughout the lifecycle.

## Example: Hiring Model

A model trained on old hiring data learns that past employees were mostly male  
It ranks men higher for new jobs  
The bias isn't in math — it's in history

> Concrete examples illustrate how abstract concepts apply in practice. Studying both successes and failures reveals patterns worth emulating or avoiding.

## Fairness vs. Accuracy

Fairness may reduce raw accuracy  
Removing biased data sometimes weakens performance, but strengthens trust  
Ethical AI balances both

## Transparency

Models should be explainable:  
Why did it make that choice?  
What inputs mattered most?  
Who is accountable for the result?

## Accountability

Ethics assigns responsibility  
Engineers, leaders, and users share it  
"No one intended harm" is not a defense

## Regulation and Standards

Governments and organizations define guardrails:  
EU AI Act  
NIST AI Risk Management Framework  
IEEE Ethics in Autonomous Systems

## Practical Mitigation Steps

Audit datasets for imbalance  
Test for demographic differences in output  
Monitor drift over time  
Document model purpose and limits

> Following systematic processes reduces mistakes and improves outcomes. Established workflows capture lessons learned so you don't have to rediscover them.

## Responsible Use Cases

Ask before building:  
Could this system harm privacy or autonomy?  
Could it amplify misinformation or exclusion?  
Who benefits, and who might be harmed?

## Human Oversight

AI should assist, not decide alone  
Keep humans in the loop for sensitive or irreversible outcomes

## Summary

Ethical AI is not optional  
Bias hides in data and design  
Transparency, accountability, and fairness keep systems safe and trusted
