# Week 9
# AI Governance

> This slide explores an important concept in applied AI. Understanding this material will help you make better decisions when evaluating opportunities and challenges in your field.

## The rules and processes that make AI safe, compliant, and accountable

> Following systematic processes reduces mistakes and improves outcomes. Established workflows capture lessons learned so you don't have to rediscover them.

## The Core Idea

Governance ensures AI systems align with company goals, laws, and ethics  
Without it, AI becomes a black box no one can control or explain

## Why It Matters

AI touches legal risk, brand trust, and safety  
Governance creates clarity:  
- Who approved it  
- What data it uses  
- How decisions are monitored

> Understanding why concepts matter helps you apply them appropriately. This context prevents cargo-cult adoption of practices that don't fit your situation.

## What AI Governance Covers

Policy: what is allowed or restricted  
Risk: identifying harm, bias, or misuse  
Process: approval and documentation  
Accountability: roles and escalation paths

> AI governance establishes policies, processes, oversight mechanisms, and accountability for responsible deployment. This includes defining acceptable use, review procedures, incident response, and continuous monitoring.

## The AI Lifecycle

Governance spans every phase:  
- Ideation: Is the use case ethical?  
- Development: Is data safe and fair?  
- Deployment: Is monitoring in place?  
- Post-Launch: Are outcomes audited?

> The AI lifecycle encompasses ideation, data preparation, modeling, deployment, monitoring, and iteration. Each stage presents distinct challenges requiring different skills, tools, and organizational capabilities.

## The Governance Triangle

People → Process → Technology  
All three reinforce each other:  
- Policies guide people  
- Processes enforce consistency  
- Technology enforces compliance

> AI governance establishes policies, processes, oversight mechanisms, and accountability for responsible deployment. This includes defining acceptable use, review procedures, incident response, and continuous monitoring.
---

## Tools for Governance

Model Cards: describe purpose, limits, and data  
Datasheets for Datasets: show where data came from  
Audit Trails: record usage and changes  
Access Controls: restrict who can run or edit models

> AI governance establishes policies, processes, oversight mechanisms, and accountability for responsible deployment. This includes defining acceptable use, review procedures, incident response, and continuous monitoring.

## Example

A bank uses an AI model for loan approval  
Governance ensures:  
- Data meets privacy laws  
- Bias tests are run  
- Decisions are explainable  
- Customers can appeal outcomes

> Concrete examples illustrate how abstract concepts apply in practice. Studying both successes and failures reveals patterns worth emulating or avoiding.

## Frameworks and Standards

NIST AI Risk Management Framework — structure for safe use  
ISO/IEC 42001 — international AI governance standard  
OECD AI Principles — fairness and transparency

## Human Oversight

Governance doesn't mean bureaucracy  
It means humans stay in control of high-impact decisions

## Reporting and Auditing

Governance demands documentation  
Logs show what model ran, what data it used, and who approved it  
This turns compliance from panic to routine

## Summary

Governance keeps AI trustworthy  
It connects ethics, policy, and technology  
Without it, you have speed without safety
