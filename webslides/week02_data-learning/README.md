# Week 2: Data and Learning

## Overview
Introduction to supervised vs unsupervised learning. Build intuition with a tiny classifier via API or scikit-learn. Emphasize evaluation and data ethics.

## Learning Objectives
- Explain supervised vs unsupervised learning with examples
- Train and evaluate a simple classifier; interpret a confusion matrix
- Identify and avoid data leakage; choose an appropriate metric
