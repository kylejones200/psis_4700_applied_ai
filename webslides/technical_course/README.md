# Technical AI Course

An 8-week technical course with deeper mathematical and implementation focus.

## Course Structure

1. **week1_Introduction-to-AI.md** - AI fundamentals and mathematical foundations
2. **week2_Regression-and-Classification.md** - Supervised learning algorithms
3. **week3_Neural-Networks.md** - Deep learning architectures
4. **week4_Natural-Language-Processing.md** - NLP algorithms and techniques
5. **week5_Generative-AI.md** - Generative models and architectures
6. **week6_AI-Ethics-and-Alignment.md** - Ethical frameworks and alignment
7. **week7_Applied-AI-Systems.md** - System design and deployment
8. **week8_Capstone-and-Reflection.md** - Project work and course synthesis

## Target Audience

- Computer science students
- Data science practitioners
- Engineers implementing AI systems
- Students with strong math/programming backgrounds

## Prerequisites

- Programming experience (Python recommended)
- Statistics and probability
- Linear algebra basics
- Calculus fundamentals

## Distinction from Other Courses

**vs. Introduction to Applied AI (intro_week series):**
- More technical depth
- Greater math emphasis
- Implementation-focused
- Algorithm understanding over application

**vs. Advanced Course (advanced_course/):**
- The technical_course is intermediate-level
- Broader coverage, less specialization
- Suitable for semester-long format
- The advanced course assumes completion of intro materials

## Usage

- CS/Data Science major coursework
- Graduate certificate programs
- Technical bootcamps
- Self-paced learning for developers
