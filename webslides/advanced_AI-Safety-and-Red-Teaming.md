## The Core Idea

AI safety ensures systems behave as intended.  
Red teaming exposes vulnerabilities before release

## Red Team Process

Define risk scenarios.  
Attempt to exploit the system.  
Record failure modes.  
Fix and re-test

## Common Risks

Prompt injection.  
Data leakage.  
Jailbreaking.  
Toxic content

## Example

Red team tries to make a model reveal private data or produce bias.  
Each outcome improves safety protocols

> Concrete examples illustrate how abstract concepts work in practice. Pay attention to context - what made this particular case succeed or fail may not transfer directly to your situation.

## Ongoing Practice

Safety isn't a one-time test.  
It's part of the AI lifecycle: design, deploy, monitor, refine
