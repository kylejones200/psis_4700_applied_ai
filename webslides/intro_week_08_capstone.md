# Week 8 — Capstone Presentations
Focus: 5-minute demo and brief (method, data, ethics, next steps)

> Capstone presentations are your opportunity to demonstrate everything you've learned by solving a real problem with AI.
---

## Presentation Structure
Problem, approach, demo, results, ethics, next steps

> Structure your presentation as: problem overview, approach taken, live or recorded demo, results achieved, ethical considerations, and next steps.
---

## Demo Checklist
Reproducibility, clarity, safety

> Demo checklist confirms reproducibility (others could run this), clarity (audience understands what's happening), and safety (you've tested edge cases).
---

## Visuals and Story
Keep it simple and compelling

> Visuals and story matter more than technical complexity. A simple solution presented well beats a complex solution explained poorly.
---

## Handling Questions
Clarify, admit limits, propose next steps

> Handling questions requires clarifying what's being asked, admitting limitations honestly, and proposing concrete next steps for future work.
---

## Rubric Highlights
Functionality, rigor, clarity, ethics, professionalism

> Rubric evaluates functionality (does it work?), rigor (is it sound?), clarity (can we understand it?), ethics (is it responsible?), and professionalism (is it polished?).
---

## Feedback Capture
Action items and owners

> Capture feedback with action items and owners so good suggestions don't get lost in the moment.
---

## Reflection Prompt
What did you learn and what will you do next?

> Reflect on what you learned technically, professionally, and about working with AI. What surprised you? What would you do differently?
---

## Demo Narrative
Problem → Approach → Evidence → Impact → Limits

> Demo narrative should flow as: problem (why does this matter?) → approach (how you solved it) → evidence (that it works) → impact (who benefits) → limits (what doesn't work yet).
---

## Live vs Recorded
Choose based on risk  
Have a backup

> Choose live versus recorded based on risk. Live demos are impressive but can fail, recorded demos are reliable but less engaging.
---

## Ethics Slide
Risks, mitigations, remaining questions

> Ethics slide explicitly addresses risks, what mitigations you implemented, and remaining questions or concerns about your system.
---

## Results Slide
Key metrics, comparisons, error analysis

> Results slide shows key metrics, comparisons to baselines, and honest error analysis. Admitting what went wrong shows maturity.
---

## Ablations (Optional)
What mattered most? Simpler win?

> Ablations (optional) demonstrate what mattered most by showing performance without key components. Sometimes simpler approaches win.
---

## Failure Modes
Known weaknesses and fallbacks

> Failure modes section lists known weaknesses, failure cases, and fallback behaviors. No system is perfect - acknowledging limitations builds trust.
---

## User Impact
Whose workflow changes? Benefits/costs

> User impact analysis identifies whose workflow changes, what benefits they receive, and what costs or adjustments they must bear.
---

## Roadmap
30/60/90-day milestones

> Roadmap with 30/60/90-day milestones shows you've thought beyond the demo to actual deployment and improvement.
---

## Handoff Artifacts
README, runbook, model card, dataset notes

> Handoff artifacts include comprehensive README, operational runbook, model card documenting your system, and dataset notes explaining data sources and limitations.
---

## Licensing and IP
Data licenses  
Code dependencies  
Attribution

> Licensing and IP considerations cover data licenses, code dependencies, and proper attribution. Using others' work requires acknowledging them.
---

## Deployment Plan (Lite)
Env, infra, monitoring, rollback

> Deployment plan (lite version) outlines environment requirements, infrastructure needs, monitoring approach, and rollback procedures.
---

## Q&A Strategy
Anticipate tough questions  
Keep scope

> Q&A strategy means anticipating tough questions (especially about limitations, costs, ethics) and staying within scope (not promising things you didn't build).
---

## Peer Review Rubric
Clarity, rigor, ethics, impact, professionalism

> Peer review rubric encourages constructive feedback on others' work. The goal is helping each other improve, not finding flaws.
---

## Mini-Activity
Pair up and run a 3-minute dry run

> Pair up with someone and run 3-minute dry runs. Practice reveals timing issues, awkward transitions, and unclear explanations.
---

## Reading List
Effective technical presentations resources

> Effective technical presentations balance technical depth with accessibility, use visuals effectively, and tell a compelling story about why this work matters.
