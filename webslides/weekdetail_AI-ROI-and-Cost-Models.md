## The Core Idea

AI must create measurable business value  
ROI proves whether the effort pays off

## Cost Components

Infrastructure: compute, storage, APIs  
People: data scientists, engineers, domain experts  
Data: cleaning, labeling, governance  
Maintenance: retraining and drift monitoring

## Value Components

Time saved  
Errors reduced  
Revenue increased  
Risk avoided  
All must be expressed in dollars or measurable KPIs

## ROI Formula

ROI = (Value – Cost) ÷ Cost  
Simple, but powerful  
Used for comparing projects and proving results

> AI ROI analysis compares total costs (development, infrastructure, operation, maintenance) against quantified benefits (efficiency gains, quality improvements, new capabilities). Many technically successful projects fail on economics.

## Cost vs. Benefit Curve

Small pilots are cheap but limited  
Scaling adds cost — but should add exponential value  
Plot ROI over time to see true return

> Benefits motivate adoption but must be weighed against costs and risks. Consider whether benefits accrue to all stakeholders or concentrate narrowly.

## Example: Customer Support Bot

$100K annual cost  
Saves 4 FTEs × $75K = $300K  
ROI = (300K – 100K) ÷ 100K = 200%

> Concrete examples illustrate how abstract concepts apply in practice. Studying both successes and failures reveals patterns worth emulating or avoiding.
---

## Ongoing Costs

APIs and retraining continue after launch  
Budget for sustained operation, not one-time build

## Beyond Money

Also track qualitative impact:  
Employee satisfaction  
Faster decision-making  
Improved compliance

## Summary

Measure everything  
Track value over time  
AI only scales when its economics work
