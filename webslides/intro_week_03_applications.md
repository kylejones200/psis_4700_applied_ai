# Week 3 — Applications Across Domains
Focus: case studies  
Practitioner talk  
Brief analysis

> This week explores real-world AI applications across different industries. Understanding how AI is actually used helps you identify opportunities in your own field and avoid common pitfalls.
---

## Why Applications Matter
Ground learning in real-world impact

> AI applications are most valuable when they solve real problems that people actually have. We'll examine concrete examples rather than speculative use cases.
---

## Healthcare
Triage, imaging, documentation  
Risks and benefits

> Healthcare AI can help doctors diagnose diseases, prioritize patient treatment, and automate documentation. However, these applications require extremely high accuracy and careful consideration of life-or-death consequences.
---

## Finance
Fraud detection, credit scoring, compliance

> Finance uses AI for detecting fraudulent transactions, scoring credit risk, and ensuring regulatory compliance. These applications must balance accuracy with fairness and explain their decisions.
---

## Manufacturing
Predictive maintenance, quality control

> Manufacturing deploys AI to predict when equipment will fail (preventing costly downtime) and automatically detect defects in products. These applications save money through prevention rather than reaction.
---

## Retail/Marketing
Recommendations, pricing, customer insights

> Retail and marketing use AI to recommend products you might like, optimize pricing based on demand, and segment customers for targeted campaigns. These systems must respect privacy while providing value.
---

## Education
Tutoring, grading aids, accessibility

> Education AI can provide personalized tutoring, assist with grading, and create accessible materials for students with disabilities. The key is augmenting teachers rather than replacing human instruction.
---

## Public Sector
Service chatbots, planning, early warnings

> Public sector applications include chatbots for citizen services, urban planning optimization, and early warning systems for emergencies. These must serve all citizens equitably regardless of technical literacy.
---

## Transportation
Routing, safety systems, logistics

> Transportation AI powers route optimization, safety systems in vehicles, and logistics planning. These applications can save lives and reduce environmental impact through efficiency.
---

## Agriculture
Yield prediction, monitoring, automation

> Agriculture uses AI to predict crop yields, monitor plant and soil health, and automate farming tasks. This helps farmers make data-driven decisions about when to plant, water, and harvest.
---

## Energy and Climate
Forecasting, optimization, monitoring

> Energy and climate applications include forecasting power demand, optimizing renewable energy systems, and monitoring environmental changes. AI can help address climate change through better resource management.
---

## Small Business
Automation of routine tasks  
Chat assistants

> Small businesses can use AI to automate routine tasks like scheduling, customer service chatbots, and bookkeeping. The key is finding affordable, ready-made solutions rather than building from scratch.
---

## Startups
Rapid prototyping  
Lean experiments

> Startups can leverage AI for rapid prototyping and running lean experiments with minimal resources. Cloud-based AI services make it possible to test ideas quickly without huge upfront investments.
---

## ROI and Feasibility
Value, cost, risk, time-to-impact

> Every AI project must consider ROI (return on investment): does the value exceed costs? How long until benefits appear? What are the risks? Business justification matters as much as technical feasibility.
---

## Data Sources
Internal systems, public data, vendors

> AI projects need data from somewhere - internal systems, publicly available datasets, or commercial vendors. Understanding your data sources and their quality is crucial before starting.
---

## Build vs Buy
APIs/platforms vs custom models

> The build vs buy decision asks whether to develop custom AI or use existing platforms and APIs. For most applications, buying or adapting existing solutions makes more sense than building from scratch.
---

## Integration Patterns
APIs, webhooks, batch jobs

> AI systems must integrate with existing workflows through APIs, automated triggers (webhooks), or scheduled batch processing. The best AI is invisible - it just makes existing processes work better.
---

## Ethics in Applications
Fairness, privacy, transparency reminders

> Every AI application must consider ethical implications: does it treat all users fairly? Does it protect privacy? Is it transparent about using AI? These aren't afterthoughts but core design requirements.
---

## Case Study Template
Problem, data, method, result, risk, next steps

> We'll analyze applications using a standard template: what problem does it solve, what data is needed, what method is appropriate, what results are expected, what risks exist, and what happens next?
---

## Guest Speaker
Practitioner insights and Q&A

> A guest practitioner will share real experiences deploying AI in their field. Pay attention to the gap between ideal scenarios and messy reality - this is where practical learning happens.
---

## Group Activity
Analyze a domain case with the template

> In groups, you'll analyze a real AI application using our template. This practice helps you think critically about AI deployments and identify potential issues before they become problems.
---

## Write-up Guidance
Evidence, clarity, limitations

> Your write-up should be evidence-based (cite sources), clear (avoid jargon), and honest about limitations. Overpromising is worse than being conservative - trust is hard to rebuild.
---

## Common Pitfalls
Vague objectives, data issues, scope creep

> Common pitfalls include vague objectives (what exactly are you optimizing?), underestimating data problems, and scope creep (trying to solve everything at once). Start small and focused.
---

## Reflection Prompt
Which domain offers a feasible, ethical project for you?

> Consider five dimensions when evaluating feasibility: value to users, cost to develop and run, technical and organizational risks, data readiness, and stakeholder buy-in. All must be positive for success.
---

## Feasibility Scoring
Value, cost, risk, data readiness, stakeholders

> Create a risk matrix that plots likelihood versus impact. High-impact risks need attention even if unlikely. Prioritize mitigations for your top risks before they derail your project.
---

## Risk Matrix
Likelihood × impact  
Prioritize mitigations

> Ask three key ethics questions for every project: Who benefits from this? Who could be harmed? Do we have informed consent from everyone affected?
---

## Ethics Quick Check
Who benefits? Who could be harmed? Consent?

> Choose KPIs (key performance indicators) that directly connect to business or user value. Technical metrics like accuracy are meaningless if they don't improve actual outcomes.
---

## KPI Selection
Tie metrics to business/user value

> Assess whether you actually have the data you need: is it accessible, high quality, sufficient volume, properly labeled, and legally usable? Data problems kill more projects than algorithm problems.
---

## Data Readiness Checklist
Access, quality, volume, labeling, privacy

> Design pilots with limited scope, clear success criteria, and realistic timelines. A successful small pilot beats a failed ambitious project and teaches you what works before scaling.
---

> Change management addresses how people adapt to new AI systems. Provide training, clear documentation, and support channels. The best technology fails if people don't understand or trust it.
---

## Change Management
Training, documentation, support channels

> When evaluating vendors, assess security practices, regulatory compliance, service level agreements, pricing models, and how easy it is to leave if needed (avoid lock-in).
---

## Vendor Evaluation
Security, compliance, SLAs, pricing, lock-in

> Use a decision tree for build vs buy: Is this AI your core competitive advantage? Do you have the expertise? Is time-to-market critical? Most answers point to buy.
---

## Build vs Buy Decision Tree
Differentiation, time-to-market, expertise

> Common integration patterns include API gateways (central point for requests), ETL pipelines (extract, transform, load data), and event buses (real-time triggers when things happen).
---

## Integration Architecture Examples
API gateway, ETL, event bus

> Security basics include authentication (who are you?), authorization (what can you do?), least privilege (minimum necessary access), and secrets management (safe storage of passwords/keys).
---
