## The Core Idea

AI used to mean stitching tools together — prompt templates, retrievers, chains.  
Now, workflows are unified: orchestration is built into the model or platform

## The Past: Tool Chaining

Old approach: models plus code wrappers.  
LangChain linked models, databases, and APIs.  
LangGraph added graph-based flow control.  
They worked — but required maintenance and custom logic

## The Present: Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP allows systems to exchange context and tools directly.  
No heavy middleware.  
Models can "talk" to databases, apps, and agents through a shared protocol

## The Shift to Platforms

Vendors now embed orchestration directly:  
OpenAI GPTs manage memory and retrieval.  
Anthropic Claude Workspaces manage context sharing.  
Gemini Apps combine text, image, and action in one interface.  
The stack is flattening — integration replaces scripting

## Why It Matters

Simpler pipelines mean:  
Less glue code.  
Fewer failure points.  
Faster deployment.  
Broader accessibility for non-engineers

> Understanding motivation helps you apply concepts appropriately rather than blindly following patterns. Context for why things matter prevents cargo-cult adoption of practices that don't fit your needs.
---

## The Future Stack

Unified Interface: natural language + UI.  
Shared Context Layer: persistent memory and embeddings.  
Secure Connectors: enterprise systems linked by MCP.  
Autonomous Agents: triggered tasks with human oversight

> Understanding trends helps you build systems that remain relevant as technology evolves. Balance anticipating the future against overinvesting in speculative capabilities that may not materialize.

## Example

A future data analyst types:  
"Generate the latest energy forecast and compare to last quarter."  
The platform retrieves data, runs models, visualizes results — no code, no chains

> Concrete examples illustrate how abstract concepts work in practice. Pay attention to context - what made this particular case succeed or fail may not transfer directly to your situation.

## What to Expect

Frameworks fade.  
Protocols unify.  
Workflows simplify.  
AI moves from construction to composition

## Summary

Old AI workflows: manual and brittle.  
Future AI workflows: seamless, context-aware, and connected by design
