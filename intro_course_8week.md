# Introduction to Applied Artificial Intelligence — 8-Week Course

## Standard (15-week) Gateway Summary
- Title: Introduction to Applied Artificial Intelligence
- Purpose: Conceptual understanding of AI systems, capabilities/limits, ethics, and applied demos using APIs.
- Outcomes: Explain core AI in plain language; describe domain use; ethics; simple demos; communicate to non-technical audiences.
- Weekly flow: History/definitions; data and learning; applications; ethics/HCI; APIs/demos; mini-capstone.

## Accelerated 8-Week Design (Delivery-ready)
- Format: 8 weeks; 3 contact hours/week + project work; hybrid/online.
- Learning outcomes: Core ideas; approaches (symbolic/statistical/generative); ethics; simple applied project with an API; communication.

### Weekly Structure
- Week 1 — What Is AI: history, definitions, demos; reflection on AI in student fields.
- Week 2 — Data and Learning: supervised vs unsupervised; hands-on simple classifier via API or scikit-learn.
- Week 3 — Applications Across Domains: case studies; practitioner talk; short analysis.
- Week 4 — Ethics and Policy: bias, privacy, transparency; NIST/OECD excerpts; mini-debate.
- Week 5 — Generative and Conversational Models: LLMs, image generation; build a small chatbot or prompt pipeline.
- Week 6 — Deployment and Integration: prototypes to workflows; APIs, cloud, MLOps basics; simple deploy to a web endpoint/notebook.
- Week 7 — Applied Project Workshop: teams select domain problem; instructor check-ins.
- Week 8 — Capstone Presentations: 5-minute demo and brief (method, data, ethics, next steps).

## Assessment
- Weekly reflections
- Applied notebooks or API exercises
- Final app published on GitHub with README and short demo link

## Position in Curriculum
